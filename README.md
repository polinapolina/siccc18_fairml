This repository contains a survey dataset, gathered to study the bias and fairness in recidivism risk prediction. The survey was dersigned to investigate the differences in risk assessment of in- versus out-group members.

For the detailed description of the survey and the finsings please see XXX.

The key features of this dataset are:

* The survey vignettes represent pre-trial defendants from Broward County, Florida, based on a dataset assembled by Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, Lauren Kirchner, and Julia Angwin. 2016. How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm. Technical Report. ProPublica.

* Crowdsourced human recidivism risk assessment by a thousand respondents in a vignette survey conducted via TurkPrime, a platform that integrates with Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk and offers more control over the profile of respondents (crowdworkers).
* The ratio of black (African-American) to white (Caucasian) survey respondents is close to 50 : 50.
* The surveys were designed to represent a balanced set of defendants by race and recidivism status.
